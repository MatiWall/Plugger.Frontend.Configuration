## Project Overview
**Project Name:**  
@plugger/configuration

**Project Summary:**  
Handling configuration of apps built using the Plugger framework and providing a context from which the config can be retrieved. The configuration will include the config for extensions that will automatically be passed to the right extension at build time.

**Objectives:**  
Simplifying configuration using JSON or YAML files.

---

## Define Objectives and Requirements
**Problem Statement:**  
Normally, configuration of React apps is done using a `.env` file. This has limited scalability and does not integrate with the extension system. This package simplifies the configuration of both the app and the individual extensions.

**Functional Requirements:**  
- [Requirement 1] Allow users to define configurations in JSON or YAML formats.
- [Requirement 2] Automatically validate configurations against schemas.
- [Requirement 3] Provide a runtime context to access configuration values.
- [Requirement 4] Enable extensions to access only their scoped configuration.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**  
- [Requirement 1] The system should be lightweight and performant.
- [Requirement 2] Ensure compatibility with the Plugger framework.
- [Requirement 3] Provide a developer-friendly API with proper error messages.

**User Personas:**  
- **Developers**: Need to configure their applications and extensions easily and scalably.
- **Extension Authors**: Require scoped configuration for their extensions without affecting the main app.

**Success Metrics:**  
- Reduction in configuration-related bugs.
- Faster onboarding for new developers using the framework.
- High adoption rate within projects built with Plugger.

## Research and Analyze
**Existing Solutions:**  
- **`.env` files**: Simple but lack scalability and schema validation.
- **Config libraries (e.g., `dotenv`, `config`, `node-config`)**: Provide basic features but do not integrate with extension-based systems.
- **Custom solutions**: Often lack standardization and validation mechanisms.

**Technology Research:**  
- JSON and YAML parsers (e.g., `js-yaml`, `json-schema` for validation).
- Context API for React.
- Plugger framework for extension handling.

**Constraints:**  
- Must work seamlessly with React and Plugger.
- Limited initial development resources.
- Backward compatibility with existing Plugger extensions.

---

## Draft High-Level Concept
**Core Features:**  
- Unified configuration system supporting JSON and YAML.
- Runtime validation of configuration against schemas.
- Scoped configuration for individual extensions.
- Developer-friendly context API for accessing config values.

**Scope:**  
- **Included:**
  - Parsing and validating configurations.
  - Providing a runtime context for accessing configurations.
  - Supporting both app-wide and extension-specific configurations.
- **Excluded:**
  - Configuration encryption or secrets management.
  - Dynamic reloading of configuration at runtime.

**User Journey Maps:**  
1. **App Developer**:
   - Define a configuration file in JSON or YAML.
   - Load the configuration into the app during build time.
   - Access the configuration values via the provided context API.
2. **Extension Author**:
   - Define schema for extension-specific configuration.
   - Access only the relevant configuration values in the extension.

**High-Level Specification Document:**  
[Attach or link to a separate specification document if needed.]

## Create the Software Architecture
**Architecture Pattern:**  
Component-based architecture with a central configuration handler and scoped contexts for extensions.

**System Components:**  
- **Configuration Loader**: Parses and validates JSON/YAML files.
- **Schema Validator**: Ensures configurations match the expected schema.
- **Context Provider**: Supplies configuration values to the app and extensions.
- **Extension Manager**: Handles extension-specific configurations.

**Data Flow:**  
1. Configuration files are loaded during build time.
2. Configurations are validated against their schemas.
3. The runtime context provides access to configuration values.
4. Extensions retrieve their scoped configuration via the context.

**Database Design:**  
No database is required; configuration data is read from files.

**APIs and Integrations:**  
- Integration with the Plugger framework for extension handling.
- Public API for loading and retrieving configurations.

**Scalability and Fault Tolerance:**  
- Ensure lightweight processing of configurations.
- Provide meaningful error messages for validation failures.

## Select Technology Stack
**Programming Languages:**  
- TypeScript

**Frameworks and Libraries:**  
- React (for context API)
- Plugger framework
- `js-yaml` (for YAML parsing)
- `ajv` (for JSON Schema validation)

---

## Prototype and Validate
**MVP Features:**  
- Load configurations from JSON/YAML files.
- Validate configurations against schemas.
- Provide a React context for accessing configuration values.
- Support scoped configuration for extensions.

**Testing Plan:**  
- Unit tests for configuration loader and validator.
- Integration tests for context API.
- End-to-end tests with sample apps and extensions.

**Validation Steps:**  
- Verify configurations load correctly for apps and extensions.
- Test schema validation with valid and invalid configurations.
- Collect feedback from early adopters.

---

## Develop and Test
**Development Workflow:**  
- Agile methodology with 2-week sprints.
- Regular code reviews and iterative development.

**Task Breakdown:**  
- Task 1: Implement configuration loader.
- Task 2: Add schema validation support.
- Task 3: Create React context for runtime access.
- Task 4: Integrate with Plugger extensions.
- Task 5: Write unit and integration tests.

**Testing Strategy:**  
- **Unit Testing**: Validate individual components like loader and validator.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure smooth interaction between app, context, and extensions.
- **Performance Testing**: Measure the efficiency of configuration loading and validation.
